# KakHunt
KakHunt is a python GUI Tool private tool which earns me 100s of bugs every month. It spawns URLS and filters Sensitive Info.

How Does it Work?
Its simple, first it uses a tool by tomnomnom to spawn all the URLS of the target specified, then according to the requirement, it will filter the sensitive files or simply the required files for further analysis!

Why does this exist?
If you're into WAPT or simple you collect files and analyse them, you know the 20-50 commands you have to type in order to even format the things properly, well this I have faced myself and I have created this. Though I initially kept this private for my team's internal Use, I later made some changes and made it public so enjoy!
