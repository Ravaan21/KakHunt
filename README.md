# KakHunt
### KakHunt is a python GUI Tool private tool which earns me several bugs every month. It spawns URLS and filters Sensitive Info.

#### How Does it Work?
Its simple, first it uses a tool by tomnomnom to spawn all the URLS of the target specified, then according to the requirement, it will filter the sensitive   files or simply the required files for further analysis!

#### Why does this exist?
If you're into WAPT or simple you collect files and analyse them, you know the 20-50 commands you have to type in order to even format the things properly, well this I have faced myself and I have created this.  
Though I initially kept this private for my team's internal Use, I later made some changes and made it public so enjoy!

NOTE:
I am not remotely close with front-end so if you wish to make this UI better then please do.  
I have used Tkinter for the UI in python.

#### What are the Dependencies?
- Python  
- Tkinter  
- WaybackUrls  

#### How to instsall?
- go install github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls@latest  
- pip install tkinter

#### How to use?
- **python3 KakHunt.py.**
